            <p>Who loves restrictions? Even they might provide some kind of speed-ups or
ensures the simplicity of algorithms. I guess the answer will be, most of the
'reasonable' people. But I can't say that I am one of them when I want to
get some fun so I'll go forward and try to bring backtracking to a 3rd party
simple push-down stateful LL(1) python parser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: this post is written with no actual intent of production-ready
code, just an experiment about can we do or not as a fun project.</p>

<h2>What is 'Backtracking'?</h2>
<p>The simplest (but definitely not to most formal) way of I guess describing this concept is doing an analogy with database transitions and rollbacks. During
a parse operation; when encountered with multiple transitions for a single token
and the current state is suitable for moving forward on more than one transitions
that the input produced, every alternative path is going to be represented as a
transaction. When starting to process an alternative, we will save the current state
and locals (like the input position, since we are going to eat tokens to determine
if we are on the right path or not) and then if we fail, we'll rollback to the state
we have saved. If we succeed, we'll move on.</p>
<h2>Multiple States from a 'Single Token'</h2>
<p>If you have worked with a language that the identifiers have the same form as other
language structures, there is a concept of 'keywords'. Let's imagine the 'else' keyword,
in theory, it suits the condition of a normal identifier and it would be possible for you
to assign it, but for state machines that need to determine routes based on the tokens,
instead of checking out the value of every different token, they use the value of only
identifier tokens as different states on the transition table when it is reserved as a string on the grammar.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">token_to_transition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reserved_strings</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But you might ask that there is still only one transition that is returned from that function even
the input was a keyword, and that means there are no alternatives. You are right. With this
kind of implementation, you can not use reserved strings (a.k.a keywords) on other occassions even
where the type of token (<code>NAME</code>) suits. You can only use them at places where you specified as
<code>'else'</code> on the raw grammar. At least without 'soft keywords'.</p>
<h3>Soft Keywords</h3>
<p>Uhm, another different concept that got into our lives. I initially saw this one in a commit
to CPython and seen the first real example of it when reading the PEP 622. It is a proposal
about bringing a 'pattern matching statement' to the Python. Since introducing a new statement
should be handled with a keyword, they choose to use 'match' and 'case'. But reserving another
name during a new python version will break a lot of code, a lot. It will even break the use
cases in the stdlib (e.g: <code>re.match()</code>), of course, that authors considered that too and they
made these 2 keywords 'soft'. The keywords act like normal keywords on the contexts and on other
occasions they act like a usual 'NAME' token. For doing that when there is some kind of ambiguity,
they try all alternatives and backtrack. Let's draft a <code>token_to_transition</code> function with supporting
'soft' keywords. Now the '<code>token_to_transition</code>' function will return either a 1-element tuple or
a 2-element tuple depending on the code-path.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">token_to_transition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">parser</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">token</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">soft_keywords</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">token</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">parser</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reserved_strings</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, if you make 'import' a soft keyword, then when the parser is in a state that expects either
a 'NAME' or an 'import' keyword, it will try both and see which one of the path will be successfully
continues.</p>
<h1>Let's Implement</h1>
<p>So, what we first need is determining some kind of strategy about whether if we are going to
consume all tokens beforehand and fill the memory, or not. As you might remember from my previous
post that, it is not uncommon for parsers to take lazy lexers as their producer and taking input
one by one as they proceed. They also don't store the results from previously produced tokens. But
when we're going to do backtracking, we need to consume 'enough' tokens beforehand and need to also
rollback when we fail to proceed that alternative.</p>
<p>Since, consuming all the tokens beforehand wouldn't be as pleasant as we used to in times before
backtracking, I plan to operate in the best way I can. And it is going to be operating as usual when
there are no ambiguity or place to backtrack, and when there is we are going to consume as little as we
can and as soon as we are clear, we'll go back to the old way and output one by one.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>     def parse(self, tokens):
         first_dfa = self._pgen_grammar.nonterminal_to_dfas[self._start_nonterminal][0]
         self.stack = Stack([StackNode(first_dfa)])
<span class="gi">+        self._tokens = _TokenGeneratorProxy(tokens)</span>

<p>Let's try to draft a <code>_TokenGeneratorProxy</code> class;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">_TokenGeneratorProxy</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p>We just implemented an iterator protocol with <code>__iter__</code> (which returns the iterator)
and the <code>__next__</code> (the function that is called on every iteration). For now, we're just
keeping a counter and returning the value we get from the original producer. But what we
need is a way of looking ahead without breaking the whole mechanism. What I have in mind
is something like this;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">token</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_tokens</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">release</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">proxy</span><span class="p">:</span>

            <span class="n">proxy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">eat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">needed</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;end of for loop&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">proxy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">eat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">eat_and_print_next_token</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which in theory should work like this;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>eating &#39;NAME&#39; as the position &#39;0&#39;

releasing the producer

eating &#39;OPERATOR&#39; as the position &#39;0&#39;
eating &#39;NAME&#39; as the position &#39;1&#39;

end of for loop

using cached token &#39;OPERATOR&#39; from the position &#39;0&#39;

locking the producer

using cached token &#39;OPERATOR&#39; from the position &#39;1&#39;
using cached token &#39;NAME&#39; from the position &#39;2&#39;
eating &#39;NEWLINE&#39; as the position &#39;3&#39;
</code></pre></div>

<p>It might look a little bit complex, but if I have to explain I would say
that, without any 'release' operation, the proxy is going to just consume
from the producer and output without storing any kind of token. When there
is a release action, it will lock a point (the counter), and record all
the tokens that it will consume until it is locked again (exit of the
context manager). When locked, the <code>proxy.eat</code> will eat in a relative
range, so if you have eaten 1 token before (index 0) the lock operation, and
try to perform <code>proxy.eat(0)</code>, it will eat the token in the position of index 1.
Also, when you performed <code>proxy.eat(0)</code> after a <code>proxy.eat(0)</code> it will return
the same thing (if performed with-in the same point). Also, it doesn't matter
how far you have eaten in a lock, it will be reset to the point of the lock
after the re-locking operation and for the ones you have already consumed, they
will come up from the cache.</p>

<p>The <code>_release_ranges</code> is a list of 3-item length records. The first one points
the state that we started eating tokens, the second one points the end (which
is set after the re-locking operation), and the third one is another list that
consists from the tokens that are eaten on that range.</p>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since we already caching the results of <code>eat</code>, it is going to be much
easier to implement a <code>can_advance</code> functionality which will just try
to go to the selected pointed, if the producer can produce no more, it
will just return <code>False</code>. Otherwise will result with a <code>True</code>.</p>
<h3>Final Quest: Implementing the real backtracking</h3>
<p>Since we already created the way of eating / caching tokens from a lazy
producer, we can safely go forward and modify the parser. As a short summary
of the mechanism;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt; parse
    for token in tokens:
        add_token(token)
&gt; add_token
    transition = token_to_transition(token)
    while True:
        try:
            plan = stack[-1].dfa.transitions[transition]
            break
        except KeyError:
            if stack[-1].dfa.is_final:
                self._pop()
            else:
                self.error_recovery(token)
                return
    stack[-1].dfa = plan.next_dfa
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you might be seen, it basically converts the input to a transition
then finds the next state by checking out the transition table of the
last state. When it founds the next transition, it sets it and continues.</p>
<p>Let's continue step by step. The first thing is that, we changed the
<code>token_to_transition</code> function to output multiple transitions, so we
need to change there to. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gd">-        transition = _token_to_transition(grammar, type_, value)</span>
<span class="gi">+        possible_transitions = _token_to_transition(grammar, type_, value)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also, it is going be too much for us to fit the functionality of finding the
next state into a <code>try/except</code>, so we're just going to split out too.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">plan</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_possible_plan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_transitions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stack</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dfa</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transitions</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">plan</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">KeyError</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">KeyError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="o">...</span> <span class="c1"># pop / error_recovery</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>get_possible_plan</code> is going to return <code>None</code>, only if there is nowhere to proceed
with the given transition. For just preserving the old habit of raising <code>KeyError</code>, we're
just going to raise that <code>KeyError</code> (which was used to raised from accessing the transition
table).</p>
<p>Let's move forward with our precious <code>get_possible_plan</code> function which will eventually
have some kind of backtracking.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_possible_plan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_transitions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">transition_table</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">possible_plans</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">transition</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">possible_transitions</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">possible_plan</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">transition_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">transition</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">possible_plan</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">possible_plans</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_plan</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The function will get the <code>possible_transitions</code>, and a <code>transition_table</code> to check
them against. It will create a temporary list that is going to contain all possible
routes with given states. Then we'll go through all the states and try to find a place
for them in the transition table.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_plans</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">None</span>
<span class="k">elif</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_plans</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">possible_plans</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If there is nothing inside of <code>possible_plans</code>, we're just going to return <code>None</code> (which
as I mentioned before, is going to equal of "we are done here"). If there is only one possible
route, it is so nice, we can just return it and exit without any trouble. But, what if there
are more then one possible plan with the current transitions. It is where, backtracking comes
in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">dead_plans</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">possible_plan_table</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">possible_plan</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">possible_plan</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">possible_plan</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">possible_plans</span><span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We are going to keep 2 different tables. One is going to be a set of <code>dead_plans</code>, and the other one is going
to be a mapping of the possible routes and how far they can proceed. Like if we have 2 possible routes and one
can eat 3 token more and then fail, and if the other one can eat 4 and fail, we'll go for the latter. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">with</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_tokens</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">release</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">token_proxy</span><span class="p">:</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">token_proxy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">can_advance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="k">break</span> <span class="c1"># nothing to do, get the best plan we have</span>
        <span class="n">token</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">token_proxy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">eat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counter</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>So we are always going to check out if there are any superior plans with <code>self._superior_plan</code>, and if we found
that all plans except one is dead, we're just going to choose the one and stop consuming the token proxy and
re-lock the current state. If we can't go further, we are just going to stop and return the first plan (which
I don't expect will happen ever).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">origin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">possible_plans</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">possible_plan_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">():</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Here it comes the real backtracking. We are moving on all possible plans, and finding the current state
which holds the transition table (<code>current_plan</code>). After that, we check if this plan is a dead-end or no.
If it is, we are just going to pass the backtracking step and continue on the next plan.</p>
<p>The for loop below that part is iterating over all the dfa pushes, which is actually the rules that it
has entered. If we wanted to see what happens when we get <code>import</code> of the <code>import x</code>, the pushes are
things like these;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[
    &lt;DFAState: stmt is_final=True&gt;,
    &lt;DFAState: simple_stmt is_final=False&gt;,
    &lt;DFAState: small_stmt is_final=True&gt;,
    &lt;DFAState: import_stmt is_final=True&gt;,
    &lt;DFAState: import_name is_final=False&gt;
]
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason we iterate a reversed version of it is finding a place where we can proceed. When we got a push
that actually produces results with our current strategy, we choose to go with it and exit from the loop.
If we can't find anything that actually works, we are just going to add this plan's root to the <code>dead_plans</code>
set and won't ever try to progress on it.</p>
<p>And finally, if we found either a supeior plan or consumed all the input (which I expect not to happen, unless
some kind of invalid input) we're just going to exit with the supeior plan;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_superior_plan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">possible_plan_table</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">winner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This was it, I really enjoyed when I was developing this since it sounded like a really funny thing to experiment with in the
beginning. By the way if you have similar thoughts or new ideas about this subject, just let me know at <a href="https://twitter.com/isidentical">twitter/@isidentical</a>,
I really would like to hear from you.</p>
